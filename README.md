# My Portfolio 

## Hi there üëã and welcome to my portfolio repo!

Hello! I'm Adrian, a dedicated Network Operations Engineer at Verizon. In the summer of 2023, I successfully graduated from the Fullstack Software Engineer Apprenticeship program at Verizon, where I honed my skills in web development.
Curious by nature, I always try to learn and be on top of the latest technologies and skills needed within the Web Dev world, just because I love what I do, and I believe in the power of continuous improvement. Whether it's exploring new programming languages, frameworks, or design principles, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and push myself to grow as a developer.
Witnessing my work come to life and its positive impacts on users bring me immense joy. While I have a special passion for Python, I also find great satisfaction in frontend development and design, and also constructing full stack applications.

Thank you for your valuable time, and I hope you will enjoy exploring some of the projects in my portfolio.üòÅ
